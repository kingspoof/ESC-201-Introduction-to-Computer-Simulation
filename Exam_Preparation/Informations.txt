It covers the theory of the course



Shit to do:
- Implement a newton solver, that uses derivatives as well as args to make the keppler-equation solver better

Algorithms, we learned in the lecture:
-> Root Finding
    Bisection
    Newtons-Method
-> Fractals:
    Population Growth
    Julia-Set, Mandelbrot-Set
-> Ordinate Differential Equations (ODE's):
    Euler's-Method
    Forward-Euler-Method
    Leapfrog-Method
    Midpoint-Method
    Runge-Katta-Method
-> Parial-Differential-Equations
    Algorithm used to solve the potential Grid
    2D-Interpolation
-> Hyperbolic PDE's
    -> Linear Advection Equations
        Looser-Method
        Lax-Method
        Upwind-Method
        Lax-Wendroff-Method
-> Finite Volume
    CIR-Method
    CTU-> Method (Cornertransport Upwind scheme)
